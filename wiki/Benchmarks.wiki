= Alchemy Database Benchmark results =

*Hardware*<br/>
2 Machines were used as Client and Server<br/>
Both: 3.0GHz Phenom X4 CPU w/ 6MB L2 and 8GB RAM @400 MHz (PC3200) w/ 1GbE LAN<br/>
(only one core per machine was used)

*Table Size*<br/>
All tables have 1 million rows w/ sequential primary keys<br/>
The rows returned from queries are random ranges w/ PKs ranging from 0 to 1million.

==Benchmark ONE==
This benchmarks show how the requests per second the server can handle varies as the number of rows returned from range queries and table-joins varies.<br/>

This graph is OLTP DB relevant (2-20 rows returned) as it measures the performance or range queries and joins returning only a small number of rows, which is an acceptable methodology in OLTP<br/>
<br/>
Y-Axis is requests/second .................. X-axis is number of rows returned<br/>

The 3 graphs were created w/ the following commands
  # {{{./Benchmark_Range_Query_Lengths.sh}}}
  # {{{./Benchmark_Range_Query_Lengths.sh JOIN}}}
  # {{{./Benchmark_Range_Query_Lengths.sh 3WAY}}}
The difference between 2-table and 3-table joins becomes less as number-of-rows increases, as can be seen on the [http://code.google.com/p/redisql/wiki/ExtendedBenchmarks Extended Benchmarks]

<br/>
==Benchmark TWO==
This is an interesting benchmark - *In Swap Performance*<br/>
Alchemy Database has an architectural advantage over any hash table based database, namely it can go into swap.<br/>
Alchemy Database also employs a database server log (called appendonly file) background rewriting technique that uses a spare core, and only 50MB of memory ... this means you can use 100% of your RAM and even go into swap, this is a minimum 2X increase in available RAM for the server<br/>
<br/>
For more information on In-Swap-Mode look [http://code.google.com/p/redisql/wiki/InSwapMode here]<br/>
<br/>
To run this benchmark you need 8GB of RAM, then run the script: {{{./IN_Swap_Performance_Test.sh}}} - NOTE: this script causes 1hour+ of severe disk thrashing to prove a point :)<br/>
This script  
  * writes 40 million 300 byte rows (11.3GB of data) to RAM,
  * this results in about 4GB being written to swap (approx the first 15million)
  * the script then tries to read the first 20 million rows (first 6GB) at random 
  * this results in 70minutes of swap-thrashing and very low performance, shown [http://allinram.info/alsosql/SWAP_TIME_to_recover.png here]
  * at about 10 million rows the performance [http://allinram.info/alsosql/Swap_0_to_20million.png improves], but it is not yet smooth, due to frequent random hard disk lookups
  * eventually (20-30 million requests), the 6GB of RAM that are "ACTIVE" are back in [http://allinram.info/alsosql/SWAP_20Mto30M.png RAM]
  * at 45-50million requests (graphed below), even though the dataset is over 40% resident in swap, the "ACTIVE" parts are being read at RAM speed _(except for occasional dips to swapping ... linux isnt perfect)_ Very few requests (<0.01%) would experience high latency in this range.
Running in In-Swap-Mode requests/second from request 45million to 50million<br/>

Y-Axis is requests/second .................. X-axis is requests<br/>

==Benchmark THREE==
Same as benchmark one but graphed logarithmically and showing how the server performs when it is returning range queries or joins w/ 2 through 50,000 result rows.

This also shows how joins scale as number of tables increase. This is OLAP territory, not OLTP, and the server is not designed for such usage, still, the server holds up well, and such tests are necessary for completeness<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: both axis are logarithmic and a 10-way table join is introduced {{{./Benchmark_Range_Query_Lengths.sh 10WAY}}}<br/>
